# Testing 

The following sections are the results of the testing throughout the SDLC for MSP-2. This information has been included in a separate document in order to keep the README document uncluttered.

## Unit Testing:
The following evidence captures were collected when testing was conducted throughout development of this project.

### Round One - Testing on MVP
13/06/2021 @ 18:08
        Typos in the JS when processed via the JShint validator
                compatability issue which required "/*jshint esversion: 6 */" to be added to the start of the JS file
        No errors located in the CSS Jigsaw,
        One warning message in the HTML validator. It isdicates the Section element should contain a h element of some type.

## Functionality Testing:
The following evidence captures were collected when testing was conducted via the GUI throughout development.

### Round One - Testing on MVP
13/06/2021 @ 18:08
        Functionality available:
                Basic HTML and CSS settings, Javascript enabled for initial geo location of weather, along with basic search (using either enter or left click to submit)
        Test Results:
                Initial location (using long/lat from browser) is operational if user allows
                Ability to search for a city (user enter to submit) partially successful.
                Ability to search for a city (user left mouse click to submit) partially successful.
                Currently any City name entered will default to the American location. 
                        Need to implement a way to locate nearest match to user browser location? Or based on history?

        Functionality to be developed
                - field validation re city entry 
                        - based on allowed entries from openweathermap? 
                        - error message surrounding initial geo location (maybe plant in the html.)
                - background picture updating based on api response
                - creation of humourous sayings/texts to be updating based on api weather results (temp or description)

### Round Two - Testing on MVP
19/06/2021
        Functionality available:
                Basic HTML and CSS settings, 
                Javascript enabled for initial geo location of weather, 
                Basic search (using either enter or left click to submit)
                Background updates based on weather main content
        Test Results:
                Initial location (using long/lat from browser) is operational if user allows - message on page if geolocation request declined
                Ability to search for a city (user enter to submit) 
                Ability to search for a city (user left mouse click to sumbit) 
                Invalid submittion does not currently produce an error
                Still exists -  any City name entered will default to the American location. 
                        - Need to implement a way to locate nearest match to user browser location? Or based on history?

        Functionality to be developed
                - field validation re city entry 
                        - based on allowed entries from openweathermap? 
                        - error message surrounding initial geo location (maybe plant in the html.)

                - creation of humourous sayings/texts to be updating based on api weather results (temp or description)
