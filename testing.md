# Testing 

The following sections are the results of the testing throughout the SDLC for MSP-2. This information has been included in a separate document in order to keep the README document uncluttered.

## Initial Unit Testing:
The following evidence captures were collected when testing was conducted throughout development of this project.

### Round One - Testing on MVP
13/06/2021 @ 18:08
        Typos in the JS when processed via the JShint validator
                compatability issue which required "/*jshint esversion: 6 */" to be added to the start of the JS file
        No errors located in the CSS Jigsaw,
        One warning message in the HTML validator. It indicates the Section element should contain a h element of some type. 
                - Due to the minimalist size of the HTML, section tags were replaced with divs. If future development causes the HTML to expand, the use of Section will be reconsidered.

## Functionality Testing:
The following evidence captures were collected when testing was conducted via the GUI throughout development.

### Round One - Testing on MVP
13/06/2021 @ 18:08
        Functionality available:
                Basic HTML and CSS settings, Javascript enabled for initial geo location of weather, along with basic search (using either enter or left click to submit)
        Test Results:
                Initial location (using long/lat from browser) is operational if user allows
                Ability to search for a city (user enter to submit) partially successful.
                Ability to search for a city (user left mouse click to submit) partially successful.
                Currently any City name entered will default to the American location. 
                        Need to implement a way to locate nearest match to user browser location? Or based on history?

        Functionality to be developed
                - field validation re city entry 
                        - based on allowed entries from openweathermap? 
                        - error message surrounding initial geo location (maybe plant in the html.)
                - background picture updating based on api response
                - creation of humourous sayings/texts to be updating based on api weather results (temp or description)

### Round Two - Testing on MVP
19/06/2021
        Functionality available:
                Basic HTML and CSS settings, 
                Javascript enabled for initial geo location of weather, 
                Basic search (using either enter or left click to submit)
                Background updates based on weather main content
        Test Results:
                Initial location (using long/lat from browser) is operational if user allows - message on page if geolocation request declined
                Ability to search for a city (user enter to submit) 
                Ability to search for a city (user left mouse click to sumbit) 
                Invalid submittion does not currently produce an error
                Still exists -  any City name entered will default to the American location. 
                        - Need to implement a way to locate nearest match to user browser location? Or based on history?

        Functionality to be developed
                - field validation re city entry 
                        - based on allowed entries from openweathermap? 
                        - error message surrounding initial geo location (maybe plant in the html.)
                - background picture updating based on api response
                - creation of humourous sayings/texts to be updating based on api weather results (temp or description)

### Round Three - Testing on MVP
22/06/2021
        Functionality available:
                Basic HTML and CSS settings, 
                Javascript enabled for initial geo location of weather, 
                Basic search (using either enter or left click to submit)
                Validation on the API response, limited to submet text confirmation alert
                Background updates based on weather main content
                Submit field clears on focus
        Test Results:
                Initial location (using long/lat from browser) is operational if user allows - message on page if geolocation request declined
                Ability to search for a city (user enter to submit) 
                Ability to search for a city (user left mouse click to sumbit) 
                Invalid submittion returns an error, this error is based on the API response and not field validation
                Still exists -  any City name entered will default to the American location. 
                        - work around is to request the user enter country code alone with city name

        Functionality to be developed
                - creation of humourous sayings/texts to be updating based on api weather results (temp or description)
                - validation on the search field itself (current error based on api results)

### Round Four - Final Functional/regression Testing before UAT
23/06/2021
        Functionality available:
                Basic HTML and CSS settings, 
                Javascript enabled for initial geo location of weather, 
                Basic search (using either enter or left click to submit)
                Validation on the API response, limited to submet text confirmation alert
                Background updates based on weather main content
                Submit field clears on focus
                Humourous quote populates based on the weather description
                
        Test Results:
                Initial location (using long/lat from browser) is operational if user allows - message on page if geolocation request declined
                Ability to search for a city (user enter to submit) 
                Ability to search for a city (user left mouse click to sumbit) 
                Invalid submittion returns an error, this error is based on the API response and not field validation
                Still exists -  any City name entered will default to the American location. 
                        - work around is to request the user enter country code alone with city name

        Functionality to be developed
                - validation on the search field itself (current error based on api results)
                        Note, as API validation has been implemented, this item has reduced priority and will be developed in the future

## User Acceptance Testing:

Due to the size and timelines of this project, there will not be a structured Alpha/Beta stage of UAT. Instead, a selection of volunteers will conduct a time boxed exploratory session. After which feedback will be collated and transformed into bugs, improvements or new features.

The following is the feedback provided from the end users from their exploratory test session:
 - It's great that the permission box pops up and I have a choice about providing my data
 - The Application is clean and clear, very simple to use
 - The jokes are corney but funny, would be of benefit to have more.
 - While the searchbar clears when I click on it to conduct a new search, it would be cleaner if it cleard on submission
 - On the Mobile phone, the page doesn't refocuss to the top after search has been submitted, causing additional user clicks...
 - It does what it says on the tin

## Performance Testing:
The following evidence are the results from the performance speed tests conducted on the deployed site:


## WAI Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Assessment

The following are the results of the Luminosity Colour Contract Ratio Analysis. This analysis determines the readability of the site based of background to foreground ratios as specified by the WAI. (https://www.w3.org/WAI/tips/designing/)
