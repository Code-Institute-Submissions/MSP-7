# Wether Application

The purpose of Milestone Project 2 is to create a simple weather application

# Project Summary

The Project will enable a user to:
- See the weather for their current location by default on opening
- Manually enter a location to search for weather results

## Benefits and Rational

Such an application will:
-	Enable the user to view Local weather (geolocation)
- Enable the User to search for a city and;
    - view the chosen citys local weather
    - view the chosen citys local date
- Have a new background on the basis of the weather results
- Display a quirky comment or joke that changes inline with the weather results

## User Stories

Below is a high-level list of User Stories for the purposes of development, testing and delivery.

Business Case User stories:

-	As a User I want to easily determine where content has been obtained from (if from, or maintained on, external sources)
-	As a Visually impaired user I want to know that all non-text elements have planned alt text equivalents
-	As a User I want to be able to quickly view the weather for my local area
- As a User I want to be able to change the location of the weather information being provided 
- As a User I want to be notified if an incorrect location has been entered
- As a User I want to be able to use this application on both my desktop/computer and mobile device

Functional Developer stories:
-	As a Developer I want all external links to open in a new browser tab
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the website HTML code passes through the official W3C validator without faults
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the website CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator without faults
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the website JavaScript code passes successfully through a linter (eg Jshint)
-	As a Developer I want to ensure that the website is responsive accross multiple devices
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the website is quick to load and responsive to User interaction.
-	As a Developer I want to ensure that images are displayed without pixelization irrespective of screen size
-	As a Developer I want to ensure there are screen captures of the finished project within the README document
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the website meets accessibility guidelines
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the website follows the principles of UX design and presents a structured layout and navigation model
-	As a Developer I want to ensure all unnecessary comments and code bits are removed before deployment
-	As a Developer I want to be able to easily deploy this site to the cloud

# Functional Requirements Scope

## Design Consistancies
The following are a list of design aspects that must be maintained throughout the site. 

The application must be clear and concise. It should display, at a minimun:
- The location
- The local date
- The current weather (text format)
- The high/low temperature for the day
- A background that reflects the weather results without detracting from the text
- Ability to search for a particular location, easily
- A quirky comment or quote that matches the weather

# Final/Existing Feature Outcomes
The final site will appears as follows:

 __Various Weather Pages__

# Future Features to be Implemented
- Currently, there is a default browser message requesting permission to know the users location. In order for the application to be GDPR compliant, A purposeful concent message will be needed. This message will need to specify the requested data, what it will be utilised for, and if it will be stored anywhere.
- Currently, after searching for a location, the search bar will only clear after the user re-clicks on the field. 
    - Future improvement will be to clear this field once the requested data has populated into the relevant html fields.
- Currently, the only error message on the site is generated on the basis of the API response. 
    - Future improvement is to develop field validation on the search bar
    - Future improvement is to increase the range of error messages available 


# Testing 

Full details and evidence of testing conducted throughout the SDLC of this project will be maintained in a seperate document called testing.md

## Production Shakedown Pre Submission

Note to Assessor: Due to GitPods behaviour surrounding links, their are numerous commit messages after the deployment that are very similar. This is due to a trial and error approach required to get the image links to work in a "production Environment".

Once the site has been deployed the HTML code will be passed throught the official W3C validator for the HTML portions:

![w3cvalidator](https://github.com/Sphere42/MSP-2/blob/master/assets/images/readme/prodhtml.PNG)

Once the site has been deployed the CSS code will be passed throught the official Jigsaw validator for the CSS portions:

![jigsawvalidator](https://github.com/Sphere42/MSP-2/blob/master/assets/images/readme/prodcss.PNG)

Once the site has been deployed the JavaScript code will be passed throught the official Jshint validator for the JavaScript portions:

![jshintvalidator](https://github.com/Sphere42/MSP-2/blob/master/assets/images/readme/prodjshint.PNG)

All elements will be visually inspected to ensure all information has been correctly populated and loaded.

All visual elements have been validated by the WAI approved Luminosity Colour Contrast Ratio Analysis checker. These results are located within the testing document.

Once the site has been deployed the site loading/performance will be tested to ensure there are no undue delays for the User

### Unfixed bugs

- Currently when a city is entered without a country code, the API automatically defaults to the American location
        Workaround in place requesting the User enter City and Country code. There will be a future improvement developed to improve this process.
- The searchbar retains the entered text until the user clicks on the bar to conduct another search.
        Furture feature will clear the searchbar on submit
- When using the application on a mobile, upon displaying the search result, the application doesn't automatically "bounce" to the top of the screen. This doesn't occur on emulators, only real devices. 
- Future improvement will be implemented to ensure the page displays from the top after searching.

# Deployment Process

## Direct Deployment
